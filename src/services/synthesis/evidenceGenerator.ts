This shows up at checkout. Families are seeing $20-40 more per weekly grocery trip compared to last year, with staples like eggs, meat, and dairy leading the increases. Imported foods and those requiring significant transportation are hit hardest.

The pattern is consistent with supply chain normalization taking longer than expected, combined with elevated energy costs that affect food production and distribution.`,
